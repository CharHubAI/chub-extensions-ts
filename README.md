# Generative Extensions TypeScript Library

This is a collection of types and common classes used by generative extensions.

Please [Read the Docs](https://docs.chub.ai/extensions) for the most up-to-date information.

It's a very small library, and each file is self-documented with heavy annotations.

Please clone/fork the [Generative Extensions Template](https://github.com/CharHubAI/extension-template) for a starting point.

The extension in the GIF above is [here](https://github.com/lloorree/maze-extension).
