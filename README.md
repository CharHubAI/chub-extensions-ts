# Chub Extensions TypeScript Library

This is a collection of types and common components used by extensions.

It's a very small library, and each file is self-documented with heavy annotations.

Check the [example](https://github.com/CharHubAI/chub-extensions-ts/blob/main/src/components/example.tsx) for a starting point.
